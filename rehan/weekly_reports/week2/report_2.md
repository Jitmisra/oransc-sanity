# O-RAN-SC MultiCluster
## Week Starting 14/SEPT

### WEEK 2

#### UPDATES
- Created an initial cluster expectations matrix of O-RAN projects with parameters (deployment, cluster needs, dependencies, etc.) for analysis. *(This is just an approach, not the final matrix)*
- **Link:** [Cluster Expectation Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VYeE3N8-x0SjDpxaGYVTyutLJSVKXlQPZuan5WvC4Sc/edit?usp=sharing)
- Deployed Nephio v4.0.0 on a single cluster and verified components (`ArgoCD`, `Nephio WebUI`, `Gitea`). *(in kind)*
- Explored steps for multi-cluster Nephio setup using `init.sh` from `nephio-project/test-infra`.
- Understood project scope: Multi-Cluster LCM with O2IMS support for O-RAN-SC.
- Drafted analysis tasks: Kubernetes cluster expectations, existing multi-cluster LCM solutions, multi-cluster connectivity, and testing strategy.

#### CHALLENGES (If any)
- Understanding the role of each deployed component and mapping them to project requirements.
