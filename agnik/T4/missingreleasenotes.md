# O-RAN SC Release Branch Analysis Report

**Generated on:** 2025-10-04  
**Analysis:** Comparison between T3 Enhanced Analysis Summary Table (release branches) and T4 Release Notes Table

## Summary
This report identifies repositories that have release branches (as documented in T3) but do not have corresponding release notes (as documented in T4).

## Methodology
1. Extracted release branch information from T3's Enhanced Analysis Summary Table
2. Cross-referenced with T4's Release Notes Table (columns A-L representing different releases)
3. Identified repositories with release branches but missing release notes

## Analysis Results

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Repositories Analyzed**: 117
- **Repositories with Release Branches**: 95
- **Repositories with Complete Release Notes**: 15
- **Repositories with Missing Release Notes**: 80
- **Repositories with No Release Branches**: 22

## Critical Findings

### Repositories with Complete Release Notes Coverage:
1. o-ran-sc/aiml-fw-aimlfw-dep
2. o-ran-sc/doc
3. o-ran-sc/it-dev
4. o-ran-sc/nonrtric-plt-a1policymanagementservice
5. o-ran-sc/nonrtric-plt-dmaapadapter
6. o-ran-sc/nonrtric-plt-rappcatalogue
7. o-ran-sc/nonrtric-plt-rappmanager
8. o-ran-sc/nonrtric-plt-sme
9. o-ran-sc/nonrtric-rapp-ransliceassurance
10. o-ran-sc/o-du-l2
11. o-ran-sc/pti-o2
12. o-ran-sc/pti-rtp
13. o-ran-sc/scp-ocu-5gnr
14. o-ran-sc/sim-a1-interface
15. o-ran-sc/smo-pkg
16. o-ran-sc/smo-teiv

### Repositories with Most Missing Release Notes:
1. **RIC Platform repositories**: Most ric-plt-* repositories have extensive release branches but no release notes
2. **RIC Applications**: Most ric-app-* repositories missing all release notes
3. **Common libraries**: com-* repositories missing all release notes
4. **AI/ML Framework**: Several aiml-fw-* repositories missing multiple release notes

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Create release notes for repositories with recent l-release branches
2. **Priority 2**: Establish systematic release note creation process for all active release branches
3. **Priority 3**: Review and update historical release notes for major releases
4. **Priority 4**: Implement automated release note generation where possible
