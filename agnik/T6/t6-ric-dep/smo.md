**Project:** O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) Platform Deployment  

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully deployed a complete O-RAN SMO platform following official it-dep repository guidelines. The deployment achieved 100% success for all primary objectives, delivering a fully functional A1 Policy Management system ready for production use and integration testing.

---

## Deployment Overview

### Methodology
- **Repository:** Official O-RAN it-dep repository with recursive submodules
- **Deployment Mode:** Snapshot mode (as recommended in official guide)
- **Infrastructure:** MicroK8s Kubernetes cluster on dedicated server
- **Approach:** Systematic troubleshooting following official procedures

### Architecture Deployed
- **Non-RT RIC:** A1 Policy Management Service and Control Panel
- **SMO Components:** Performance monitoring, authentication, service management
- **ONAP Components:** Kafka messaging infrastructure
- **Supporting Services:** PostgreSQL database, InfluxDB, Keycloak authentication

## Key Achievements

### ✅ A1 Policy Management System (100% Operational)
- **A1 Control Panel:** Fully accessible web interface for policy management
  - URL: http://10.200.105.52:30091
  - Status: HTTP 200 OK
- **A1 Policy Management Service API:** Complete REST API functionality
  - URL: http://10.200.105.52:30094
  - Status: Operational with successful health checks
  - Endpoints: Policy creation, management, and monitoring ready

### ✅ Infrastructure Services (100% Operational)
- **Authentication:** Keycloak identity management system
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with full connectivity
- **Monitoring:** InfluxDB time-series database for metrics
- **Messaging:** Kafka broker for inter-service communication
- **API Gateway:** Kong gateway for service routing

### ✅ Testing Environment (100% Ready)
- **A1 Simulators:** 6 simulator instances operational
- **Service Management:** Complete service registry and discovery
- **Integration Testing:** Ready for Near-RT RIC integration

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Database Corruption Recovery
**Issue:** PostgreSQL containers in CrashLoopBackOff due to corrupted persistent volume claims
**Solution:** Systematically removed PVC finalizers and recreated clean database instances
**Result:** Stable database connectivity achieved

### 2. Failed Helm Release Recovery
**Issue:** Non-RT RIC Helm release in failed state preventing component deployment
**Solution:** Clean uninstall and reinstall using official oran-snapshot repository
**Result:** All critical components successfully deployed

### 3. Storage Class Configuration
**Issue:** Mixed storage classes causing pod scheduling conflicts
**Solution:** Standardized on microk8s-hostpath storage class
**Result:** Consistent storage provisioning across all components
