- No source code compilation step

**Original Error**:
```
ERROR: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/rapps-jwt": not found
```

**Solution Applied**:
- Created `Dockerfile_jwt_fixed` with multi-stage build
- Added Go source code compilation step
- Used proper Go module dependency management
- Implemented security best practices with non-root user
- Added health check and proper error handling

**Fixed Build Process**:
```bash
sudo docker build -f service-exposure/Dockerfile_jwt_fixed -t nonrtric-jwt-fixed:latest service-exposure/

**Features**:
- Multi-stage build with Go 1.17
- Alpine Linux base for minimal size
- Non-root user execution for security
- Health check endpoint
- JWT token management for Keycloak integration
- Kubernetes client integration
- TLS/SSL certificate support

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Binary Files
**Problem**: The JWT Dockerfile expects a pre-compiled binary (`rapps-jwt`) that doesn't exist in the build context.

**Error**:
```
ERROR: failed to solve: failed to compute cache key: failed to calculate checksum of ref: "/rapps-jwt": not found
```

**Solution**: Would require either:
1. Adding the missing binary file to the build context
2. Modifying the Dockerfile to compile from source code
3. Using a different build approach

### Issue 2: Build Context Dependencies
**Problem**: Some Dockerfiles require specific build contexts or pre-built artifacts.

**Solution**: Building from the correct directory context and ensuring all required files are present.
