### aiml-fw-awmf-modelmgmtservice Dockerfiles build verification (linux/amd64)

**Scope**
- All builds are successful after fixes

**Discovered Dockerfiles**
- `Dockerfile` (root directory)

**Build commands**
```bash
# Model Management Service
docker build --network=host -t aiml-modelmgmtservice:test .
```

**Issues Found and Fixed**
1. **Network connectivity issues**: The initial build failed due to network timeouts when downloading Go modules from proxy.golang.org. This was resolved by using `--network=host` flag during build.
2. **ENV format warning**: Fixed legacy ENV format from `ENV MME_DIR /home/app/` to `ENV MME_DIR=/home/app/` to follow modern Docker best practices.

**Results**
- aiml-modelmgmtservice:test â€” SUCCESS (75.9s build time) - Fixed network connectivity issues

**Summary**
- Total Dockerfiles tested: 1
- Successful builds: 1
- Failed builds: 0 (after fixes)
- Issues fixed: 2 (network connectivity and ENV format)
